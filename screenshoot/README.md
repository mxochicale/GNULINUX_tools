screenshoot with gimp
---


When using only 
```
./screenshoot.sh
```
creates an imagefile with data, time and image extension and then
opens gimp for preprocessing the image (e.g. resize the image, change color, etc.)


It can also be added a name to the image files as:

```
./screenshoot.sh imagefilename.png
```


NB. Change the permissions to run the sh scripts using "chmod +x * .sh" 


#TODO

* create a command to move the files from this path to the path 
where the file is needed!
